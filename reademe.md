TEXT SENTENCE SIMILARITY:
This project aims to measure the similarity between two text sentences using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It provides a Python-based solution that allows users to input two sentences and receive a similarity score based on the chosen algorithm.
Text sentence similarity refers to the measurement of how similar or related two given sentences are in terms of their content, meaning, or structure. It is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis, with various applications, such as information retrieval, document clustering, machine translation, and more.
## Features

- Sentence similarity calculation using different algorithms.
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
- Extensible architecture for adding new similarity algorithms.
